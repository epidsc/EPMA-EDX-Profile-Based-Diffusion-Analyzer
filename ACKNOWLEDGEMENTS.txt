ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The development of this Diffusion Analyzer was greatly influenced by the foundational idea proposed by Dr. D.A.S Amarasinghe, who suggested the concept of extracting diffusion coefficients from EDX scan data.

The computational methodology, including the gradient-based clustering, multimodel fitting, and the PyQt5 GUI, were independently developed and implemented by Sanathanan Uruthireswaran.
